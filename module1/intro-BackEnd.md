# Module 1 Overview

At this point you've worked on the front end, or a client side,
of your web application.
As we know, the front end consists of all the HTML,
CSS and JavaScript that runs in the browser.
This code is written to control how web pages will be displayed,
and to manipulate pages based on user interaction.
This would be sufficient when developing a static web page or
website.
But if you want to develop a full-stack web application that
uses dynamic data, you'll need a back end that can store data
after the user exits the app, and
that can later retrieve that data.
Your back end will consist of a database that stores and
provides access to the data for your app.
As well as a web application server that handle requests from
clients, communicates with the database and
then sends that information back to the client.
Throughout this module, we'll take a deeper look at each of
this components, as we prepare to dive deeper into each one.
By the end of this module, you should have a better
understanding of how web servers work.
And what you'll need in order to write your own back
end for your web app.
Let's get started.


In this module, you will:

* Identify the components of a web application
* Identify the work that is involved in back-end web development
* Explore the fundamental concepts of RESTful APIs
* Explore HTTP and how it allows Web communication
* Practice identifying the proper HTTP request or response types for common scenarios

These are fundamental concepts that will really set you up for success if you're interested in 
continuing with back-end web development or simply understanding the concepts that are relevant 
to the Web. Many of these concepts can be complex and could be covered on their own in separate 
courses. Additionally, there are an abundance of modern frameworks and tools that use various 
architecture In this module, we'll give a brief overview of the concepts as they relate to 
building a simple web app. This will give you exposure to the most important and fundamental 
concepts of back-end web development, and give you practice applying these concepts, so that 
you'll be set up for success if you choose to further your learning on these topics.

Let's get started!
