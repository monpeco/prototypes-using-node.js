# Module Overview

Now that we've explored what's involved in developing a web
backend, let's get started writing the application
server for your app.
We've identified what an application server does.
It listens for
a request from clients, interprets those requests,
communicates with the database and responds appropriately.
We could write all of the code for
this server from scratch, but reinventing the wheel is
not something most developers want to spend time doing.
Instead, we can take advantages of platforms that make our
work easier.
NodeJS is a JavaScript platform that
allows us to write JavaScript code for web servers.
We'll take advantage of the capabilities of NodeJS as
well as some additional add-ons in order to simplify the code
we write for our server.
This will allow us to focus on the specific features that make
our app unique, as opposed to rewriting the basic code that
nearly every server has to set up.
In this module we'll learn more about NodeJS and
use it to set up an application server that can listen for and
respond to client requests.
We'll walk through this process using a sample application,
and then you'll be able to do the same with your own web app.
Let's get started.



Module 2 Overview

This module will introduce you to the basics of using **Node.js** and **Express** to create web apps. 
We'll walk through the components of Node.js and Express apps and setup a sample Hello, World! app, 
before you use what you've learned to set up the Node.js project for your own web app.

In this module you will:

* Become familiar with using Node.js to set up and run basic web servers
* Become familiar with using Express with Node.js to create basic Node.js apps
* Create a web API to handle http requests by defining routes in an Express app
