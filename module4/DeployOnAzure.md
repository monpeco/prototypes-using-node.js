#### Module 4 | Deploying on Azure   Module Overview   Introduction

# Intro to Module 4 - Deployment and Analytics

Now that you have an app it's time to get it up and into "the cloud". This means you will be taking your code and making 
it available for customers all around the world. We call this process of making your project available to customers 
"deployment", and in this module we'll show you how to deploy your code with a technology called "azure".

In this module we'll cover

* what is azure?
* how to sign up for an azure account
* how to deploy a basic web app

#### Module 4 | Deploying on Azure   Intro to Azure   What Is Azure

# Sign up for Azure

An Azure account is simply an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in a directory that is trusted by Azure AD, 
such as a work or school organization. If you don't belong to one of these organizations, you can sign up for an Azure 
account by using your Microsoft Account, which is also trusted by Azure AD.

Follow this link to sign up for an Azure account: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/

Note that to create an Azure account you MUST have both a phone number and a credit card. This is how Azure makes sure you 
are a person and not a robot trying to sign up for free stuff. Your credit card will not be charged if you follow the 
instructions in this course, but you must enter in a valid credit card to access the free materials.

### Logging In

Once you have an Azure log in, you should sign into your Azure portal:

1. In your Web browser, to open your Azure Portal, navigate to http://ms.portal.azure.com
2. If this is your first time it will offer you a tour - this can be helpful.
3. Once you have successfully signed in you should see a dashboard that looks like the following:

#### Module 4 | Deploying on Azure   Intro to Azure   Speak Azure

# Speak Azure

There are a number of terms we will use as we get to know Azure better, here is some basic terminology to help you "speak Azure":

* **Azure portal** - The home page of your portal is referred to as the Azure Dashboard (the dashboard is the area with the blue background in the image below). You will see your dashboard displayed each time you log in. Your Azure dashboard provides you with an at-a-glance view of your Azure projects. You can access your portal at: http://portal.azure.com
* **resource** - Every time that you want to use a service, you'll create an instance of that service in a subscription. Each instance of a service is referred to as a "resource".
Most resources can have an associated cost. This cost is often related to how the resource is being used, such as the performance of the resource, or the number of requests that it can handle. If you need services to have more performance, higher request throughput, or more advanced features, you are likely to incur higher costs. All the resources we will use in this course have a free offering, and the option to add more support if you choose to pay for it
* **resource group** - You can group resources that serve a common purpose together into what's called a "resource group". You can think of a resource group as a (mostly) conceptual grouping of resources, rather than a strict categorization.
* **blade** - When you are working with a resource there are different sub views of that resource. These sub views are called "blades".
