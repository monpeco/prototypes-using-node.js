Building Functional Prototypes using Node.js


# Course Overview

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. JavaScript is a great choice as a first programming language. 
You don't need any special tools or programs other than a web browser to write and run JavaScript code. JavaScript 
is a popular language and learning it will allow you to create dynamic webpages as well as server-side applications.

If you took the prerequisite to this course DEV279x - Building Interactive Webpages using JavaScript, you've already 
used JavaScript in front-end development to build interactive webpages.

This course will focus on a more modern use of JavaScript for server-side development. We'll use a platform called 
**Node.js** to write server code, and a database engine called SQLite to create and access a database for the application. 
We'll then take a look at Azure's platform for hosting web apps, deploy our apps to the Web using Azure's Web App Service,
 and monitor our app's performance once it's live using Azure's App Insights.

By the end of this course, you will have a Node.js app that is live and accessible on the Web.

Here's a breakdown of the course structure:

* In **module 1**, we'll start with an overview of back-end web development. You'll become familiar with the terminology and concepts involved in back-end web development so that you have an idea of what you'll do to build the back-end for your web app.

* In **module 2**, you'll learn about Node.js, the JavaScript engine that will allow you to write server-side JavaScript code, and Express, a helpful framework built on top of Node.js. You'll walk through a sample activity using Node.js and Express to create a basic web app server that can listen for requests from clients.

* In **module 3**, we'll focus on databases. You'll learn the basics of structuring SQL queries to perform CRUD operations on data. You'll then learn the basics of SQLite and write JavaScript code for your web app to connect to SQLite for data operations.

* In **module 4**, you'll finally be able to deploy your app to the Web. You'll get an overview of Azure and the services it provides for developers. You'll then learn about a few options for deploying your web app to Azure as you walk through the process using a sample application. Once your app is live on the Web, you'll learn how to take advantage of Azure App Insights.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

* Distinguish between front-end and back-end web development

* Create a basic web server using Node.js

* Understand the uses and types of databases and DBMSs

* Construct SQL queries to perform CRUD operations on a database

* Deploy a web app on Azure

I hope you're excited to get started!
