# Sign up for Azure

An Azure account is simply an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in a directory that is trusted by Azure AD, 
such as a work or school organization. If you don't belong to one of these organizations, you can sign up for an Azure 
account by using your Microsoft Account, which is also trusted by Azure AD.

Follow this link to sign up for an Azure account: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/

Note that to create an Azure account you MUST have both a phone number and a credit card. This is how Azure makes sure you

instructions in this course, but you must enter in a valid credit card to access the free materials.
